# Trains
Trains is a game based off the board game "Ticket to Ride". This repo originated from course work for CS 4500 "Software Development"

The main page for the course can be found here: https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f21/index.html

This repo contains all the work from this course:
  - Folders B-E are finger exercises meant to introduce python libraries for relevant tasks: parsing stdin, json, gui, and tcp.
  - The Trains subfolder contains the code for the Trains game.
    - The Game: Trains: https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f21/trains.html
  - Folders 3-10 contain integration tests for different components in Trains.
