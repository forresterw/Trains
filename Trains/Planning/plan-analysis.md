## Clarifying Questions

1. How can a player "cheat/misbehave" when they interact through an Interface?
2. Are tournaments multiple rounds of the same players or single-elimination games in parallel?
3. How much visibility of the game state should a player have?
- For instance, can the player see the number of color cards the referee still has. What will happen if a player attempts to draw from an empty deck(visible/invisible)? The spec says "the referee ignores the request of the player". Does this mean their turn ends or will the player be allowed to make a connection with the cards they already have.
